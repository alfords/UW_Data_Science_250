1) Open http://continuum.io/downloads in a web browser.
2) Save the Anaconda-2.2.0 installer to your desktop (in windows this is an exe, and in Linux and Mac it is a .sh file)
3) Run the installer.
   * It can safely be installed locally without administrator permissions as "Just Me"
   * It would be best to let anaconda/python2.7 be the default.  If you already have a Python install you are using, feel free to unselect these options.
4) When finished, launch ipython notebook.  This will open a new web browser/tab with the ipython environment.
   * On windows, browse via Start Menu->Anacond ->iPython Notebook
   * On Linux/Mac, at a shell/terminal, type "ipython notebook"
5) Create a new "python2" notebook (button on the top right hand side of the page that was opened)
6) In an empty cell, type:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
plt.plot(np.arange(-10,10), np.arange(-10, 10)**3)

7) Press <shift> - <Enter> to execute that code.  A graph of y = x^3 should display.
8) If there are any problems, post in the linkedin group, and we'll troubleshoot together.
9) (optional, recommended) Read the User Interface Tour, and Notebook Help from the "Help" menu
